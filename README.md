# Java-Invoice-Generator

One-line description: Java application to generate detailed invoices from a list of products and customer information.

Summary: This Java application models a simple invoice generator using basic object-oriented principles. It defines `Product` and `Customer` classes for managing product details and customer information, respectively. The main class, `App`, initializes a list of products and a customer, then attempts to generate an invoice in JSON format. The `generateInvoice` method performs validation on product details and calculates the total price, including a sales tax. The final output is a JSON string that includes the date of purchase, customer details, product list with prices, total sales tax, and the total price, providing a complete overview suitable for e-commerce or retail applications.
